2. Project Overview


## Project Overview
The **Meal Approach** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in [IMAD] subject. This application was created using the programming language **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to provide recommended meals for the user based on the input.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.


### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to assist users to plan and make decisions based on their preffered meals.It provides users with meals options at a certin time of day, allowing users to save time on meal decisions.

### Key Features:
- Feature A: Allows users to enter time of day.
- Feature B: Displays a meal suggestion based on the time you entered. 
- Feature C: The reset function clears the input and improves suggestion.
-  
The aim of these features is to provide a platform that helps users to choose meals based on the time of day.
   
4. Design Considerations
------------------------

## Design Consideration
The design of the **[Meal Approach]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an instinctive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is simple, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.


5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

## GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled safe coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project honor.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. 

This includes:
- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app is functional.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for the apps distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push any changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

- This section educates students on why they should understand GitHub version control and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

7. Challenges and Learnings

## Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: I had issues with adding pictures to the backround. 
   - **Solution**:  I watched a YouTube video to assist me on how to add pictures to the backround.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: I had issues with running the app.
   - **Solution**: I went to YouTube and searched another way of running the app.
From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

8. Future Enhancements

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:
1. **Feature 1**: Users can set a calorie intake for their meals.
2. **Feature 2**: Users can set up a reminder to notify themselves when its time to eat.
3. **Feature 3**: Users can set up a waring alert to retrict themselves from eating too much while they on a diet.

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for the end-user
