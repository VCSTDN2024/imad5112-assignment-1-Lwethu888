2. Project Overview


## Project Overview
The **Meal Approach** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in [IMAD] subject. This application was created using the programming language **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to provide recommended meals for the user based on the input.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.


### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to assist users to plan and make decisions based on their preffered meals.It provides users with meals options at a certin time of day, allowing users to save time on meal decisions.

### Key Features:
- Feature A: Allows users to enter time of day.
- Feature B: Displays a meal suggestion based on the time you entered. 
- Feature C: The reset function clears the input and improves suggestion.
-  
The aim of these features is to provide a platform that helps users to choose meals based on the time of day.
   
4. Design Considerations
------------------------

## Design Consideration
The design of the **[Meal Approach]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an instinctive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is simple, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.


5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

## GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled safe coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project honor.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. 

This includes:
- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app is functional.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for the apps distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push any changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

- This section educates students on why they should understand GitHub version control and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

*Caption for screenshot 3: The lateinit means that these variables will be initialized later
                           These variables correspond to the UI components

*Caption for screenshot 6: Converts the users input to lowercase for comparison.
                          The use of the when statement provides a meal suggestion for the specific time of day.
                          If the input doesn't match the time of day an exception is thrown that they must enter the appropriate value.
                          The catch captures the exception and displays an error message.

7. Challenges and Learnings

## Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: I had issues with adding pictures to the backround. 
   - **Solution**:  I watched a YouTube video to assist me on how to add pictures to the backround.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: I had issues with running the app.
   - **Solution**: I went to YouTube and searched another way of running the app.
From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

8. Future Enhancements

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:
1. **Feature 1**: Users can set a calorie intake for their meals.
2. **Feature 2**: Users can set up a reminder to notify themselves when its time to eat.
3. **Feature 3**: Users can set up a waring alert to retrict themselves from eating too much while they on a diet.

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for the end-user
